I'm stumbling through getting a quick blogging solution going.

So far, it looks like GitHub Pages is a wonderful *free* resource. That, combined with the ability to fork someone else's getting-started work, is amazing.

The steps:
1. Get a GitHub account, if you don't already have one.
1. Fork [Barry Clark's jekyll-now repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
1. Rename your fork's repository to `<yourgithubname>.github.io`.
1. Done

If you are intersted in the same, please check out Barry Clark's extremely helpful repo and explanations:
