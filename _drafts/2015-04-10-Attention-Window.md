title: Attention Window
---

There are many nuggets of information in the universe. More are created every moment.

You have a temporal window of attention, limited by brain capacity. Yours is a finite window, sliding through time, with only a certain number of slots for information nuggets. You have finite space.

Each of your information slots is precious. You are only aware of the ones in your sliding window, but they are all important. They define the experience that is your life.

How are you going to spend your attention window?
